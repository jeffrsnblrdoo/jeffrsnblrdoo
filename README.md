I’m Neil Jefferson A. Belardo, a 4th year Computer Science student passionate about frontend development. I enjoy building user-friendly interfaces and working on creative web projects. Currently, I’m developing an **Investment Calculator** to sharpen my skills and explore new challenges. I have experience with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**, and I'm currently learning **Angular** to broaden my frontend expertise.
